## AltArch | Alternate Archives 
Welcome to AltArch, a project about playing, remaking, and experimenting with digital archival database, interface, and content.

Digital Archives have often been considered as liberatory, open access spaces that preserve cultural heritage material and make it accessible for a broad audience. Historically, however, archival form and impulse can be traced to colonial imperatives. The colonial archive was a technology of control, intended to better manage the colonized peoples. Colonial archives were spaces of erasure, absence, and marginality: often presenting the perspective of the colonial powers, and codifying troubling colonial ideologies. As we begin to digitize material from colonial archives, and move towards building digital archives in general, we must be careful not to reiterate the problematic tendencies of colonial archives.

AltArch investigates methods of decolonizing digital archives. I am interested in:
- expertimenting with archival interface and design 
- visualizing archival content
- building scripts that allow you to remix archival data
- constructing archives with material not historically considered part of the Archive

You can follow my experiments [here](https://altarch.wordpress.com/).

I welcome collaborators to join me in conceptualizing new experiments in archives. I am interested in finding new archives (particularly related to race, the Global South, or postcoloniality) that we can play with, and new modes of decolonizing these archives. You can either send in an inquiry through my website, or post an [Issue on this GitHub repo](https://github.com/shreethorat/AltArch/issues).
